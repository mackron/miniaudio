I deal with all security related issues publicly and transparently, and it can sometimes take a while before I
get a chance to address it. If this is an issue for you, you need to use another library. The fastest way to get
a bug fixed is to submit a pull request, but if this is impractical for you please post a ticket to the public
GitHub issue tracker.
