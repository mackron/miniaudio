1. Introduction
===============
This library is used to abstract access to the regular file system and archives such as ZIP files.

1.1. Basic Usage
----------------
The main object in the library is the `fs` object. Below is the most basic way to initialize a `fs`
object:

```c
fs_result result;
fs* pFS;

result = fs_init(NULL, &pFS);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // Failed to initialize.
}
```

The above code will initialize a `fs` object representing the system's regular file system. It uses
stdio under the hood. Once this is set up you can load files:

```c
fs_file* pFile;

result = fs_file_open(pFS, "file.txt", FS_READ, &pFile);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // Failed to open file.
}
```

Reading content from the file is very standard:

```c
size_t bytesRead;

result = fs_file_read(pFS, pBuffer, bytesToRead, &bytesRead);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // Failed to read file. You can use FS_AT_END to check if reading failed due to being at EOF.
}
```

In the code above, the number of bytes actually read is output to a variable. You can use this to
determine if you've reached the end of the file. You can also check if the result is FS_AT_END.

To do more advanced stuff, such as opening from archives, you'll need to configure the `fs` object
with a config, which you pass into `fs_init()`:

```c
#include "extras/backends/zip/fs_zip.h" // <-- This is where FS_ZIP is declared.

...

fs_archive_type pArchiveTypes[] =
{
    {FS_ZIP, "zip"},
    {FS_ZIP, "pac"}
};

fs_config fsConfig = fs_config_init(FS_STDIO, NULL, NULL);
fsConfig.pArchiveTypes    = pArchiveTypes;
fsConfig.archiveTypeCount = sizeof(pArchiveTypes) / sizeof(pArchiveTypes[0]);

fs_init(&fsConfig, &pFS);
```

In the code above we are registering support for ZIP archives (`FS_ZIP`). Whenever a file with a
"zip" or "pac" extension is found, the library will be able to access the archive. The library will
determine whether or not a file is an archive based on it's extension. You can use whatever
extension you would like for a backend, and you can associated multiple extensions to the same
backend. You can also associated different backends to the same extension, in which case the
library will use the first one that works. If the extension of a file does not match with one of
the registered archive types it'll assume it's not an archive and will skip it. Below is an example
of one way you can read from an archive:

```c
result = fs_file_open(pFS, "archive.zip/file-inside-archive.txt", FS_READ, &pFile);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // Failed to open file.
}
```

In the example above, we've explicitly specified the name of the archive in the file path. The
library also supports the ability to handle archives transparently, meaning you don't need to
explicitly specify the archive. The code below will also work:

```c
fs_file_open(pFS, "file-inside-archive.txt", FS_READ, &pFile);
```

Transparently handling archives like this has overhead because the library needs to scan the file
system and check every archive it finds. To avoid this, you can explicitly disable this feature:

```c
fs_file_open(pFS, "archive.zip/file-inside-archive.txt", FS_READ | FS_VERBOSE, &pFile);
```

In the code above, the `FS_VERBOSE` flag will require you to pass in a verbose file path, meaning
you need to explicitly specify the archive in the path. You can take this one step further by
disabling access to archives in this manner altogether via `FS_OPAQUE`:

```c
result = fs_file_open(pFS, "archive.zip/file-inside-archive.txt", FS_READ | FS_OPAQUE, &pFile);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // This example will always fail.
}
```

In the example above, `FS_OPAQUE` is telling the library to treat archives as if they're totally
opaque and that the files within cannot be accessed.

Up to this point the handling of archives has been done automatically via `fs_file_open()`, however
the library allows you to manage archives manually. To do this you just initialize a `fs` object to
represent the archive:

```c
// Open the archive file itself first.
fs_file* pArchiveFile;

result = fs_file_open(pFS, "archive.zip", FS_READ, &pArchiveFile);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // Failed to open archive file.
}


// Once we have the archive file we can create the `fs` object representing the archive.
fs* pArchive;
fs_config archiveConfig;

archiveConfig = fs_config_init(FS_ZIP, NULL, fs_file_get_stream(pArchiveFile));

result = fs_init(&archiveConfig, &pArchive);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // Failed to initialize archive.
}

...

// During teardown, make sure the archive `fs` object is uninitialized before the stream.
fs_uninit(pArchive);
fs_file_close(pArchiveFile);
```

To initialize an `fs` object for an archive you need a stream to provide the raw archive data to
the backend. Conveniently, the `fs_file` object itself is a stream. In the example above we're just
opening a file from a different `fs` object (usually one representing the default file system) to
gain access to a stream. The stream does not need to be a `fs_file`. You can implement your own
`fs_stream` object, and a `fs_memory_stream` is included as stock with the library for when you
want to store the contents of an archive in-memory. Once you have the `fs` object for the archive
you can use it just like any other:

```c
result = fs_file_open(pArchive, "file-inside-archive.txt", FS_READ, &pFile);
if (result != FS_SUCCESS) {
    // Failed to open file.
}
```

In addition to the above, you can use `fs_open_archive()` to open an archive from a file:

```c
fs* pArchive;

result = fs_open_archive(pFS, "archive.zip", FS_READ, &pArchive);
```

When opening an archive like this, it will inherit the archive types from the parent `fs` object
and will therefore support archives within archives. Use caution when doing this because if both
archives are compressed you will get a big performance hit. Only the inner-most archive should be
compressed.


1.2. Mounting
-------------
There is no notion of a "current directory" in this library. By default, relative paths will be
relative to whatever the backend deems appropriate. In practice, this means the "current" directory
for the default system backend, and the root directory for archives. There is still control over
how to load files from a relative path, however: mounting.

You can mount a physical directory to virtual path, similar in concept to Unix operating systems.
The difference, however, is that you can mount multiple directories to the same mount point in
which case a prioritization system will be used. There are separate mount points for reading and
writing. Below is an example of mounting for reading:

```c
fs_mount(pFS, "/some/actual/path", NULL, FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
```

In the example above, `NULL` is equivalent to an empty path. If, for example, you have a file with
the path "/some/actual/path/file.txt", you can open it like the following:

```c
fs_file_open(pFS, "file.txt", FS_READ, &pFile);
```

You don't need to specify the "/some/actual/path" part because it's handled by the mount. If you
specify a virtual path, you can do something like the following:

```c
fs_mount(pFS, "/some/actual/path", "assets", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
```

In this case, loading files that are physically located in "/some/actual/path" would need to be
prexied with "assets":

```c
fs_file_open(pFS, "assets/file.txt", FS_READ, &pFile);
```

Archives can also be mounted:

```c
fs_mount(pFS, "/game/data/base/assets.zip", "assets", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
```

You can mount multiple paths to the same mount point:

```c
fs_mount(pFS, "/game/data/base.zip", "assets", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
fs_mount(pFS, "/game/data/mod1.zip", "assets", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
fs_mount(pFS, "/game/data/mod2.zip", "assets", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
```

In the example above, the "base.zip" archive is mounted first. Then "mod1.zip" is mounted, which
takes higher priority over "base.zip". Then "mod2.zip" is mounted which takes higher priority
again. With this set up, any file that is loaded from the "assets" mount point will first be loaded
from "mod2.zip", and if it doesn't exist there, "mod1.zip", and if not there, finally "base.zip".
You could use this set up to support simple modding prioritization in a game, for example.

If the file cannot be opened from any mounts it will attempt to open the file from the backend's
default search path. Mounts always take priority. When opening in transparent mode with
`FS_TRANSPARENT` (default), it will first try opening the file as if it were not in an archive. If
that fails, it will look inside archives.

You can also mount directories for writing:

```c
fs_mount_write(pFS, "/home/user/.config/mygame", "config", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
```

You can then open a file for writing like so:

```c
fs_file_open(pFS, "config/game.cfg", FS_WRITE, &pFile);
```

When opening a file in write mode, the prefix is what determines which write mount point to use.
You can therefore have multiple write mounts:

```c
fs_mount_write(pFS, "/home/user/.config/mygame",            "config", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
fs_mount_write(pFS, "/home/user/.local/share/mygame/saves", "saves",  FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
```

Now you can write out different types of files, with the prefix being used to determine where it'll
be saved:

```c
fs_file_open(pFS, "config/game.cfg", FS_WRITE, &pFile); // Prefixed with "config", so will use the "config" mount point.
fs_file_open(pFs, "saves/save0.sav", FS_WRITE, &pFile); // Prefixed with "saves", so will use the "saves" mount point.
```

By default, you can move outside the mount point with ".." segments. If you want to disable this
functionality, you can use the `FS_NO_ABOVE_ROOT_NAVIGATION` flag:

```c
fs_file_open(pFS, "../file.txt", FS_READ | FS_NO_ABOVE_ROOT_NAVIGATION, &pFile);
```

In addition, any mount points that start with a "/" will be considered absolute and will not allow
any above-root navigation:

```c
fs_mount(pFS, "/game/data/base", "/gamedata", FS_MOUNT_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);
```

In the example above, the "/gamedata" mount point starts with a "/", so it will not allow any
above-root navigation which means you cannot navigate above "/game/data/base" when using this mount
point.

Note that writing directly into an archive is not supported by this API. To write into an archive,
the backend itself must support writing, and you will need to manually initialize a `fs` object for
the archive an write into it directly.


1.3. Enumeration
----------------
You can enumerate over the contents of a directory like the following:

```c
for (fs_iterator* pIterator = fs_first(pFS, "directory/to/enumerate", FS_NULL_TERMINATED, 0); pIterator != NULL; pIterator = fs_next(pIterator)) {
    printf("Name: %s\n",   pIterator->pName);
    printf("Size: %llu\n", pIterator->info.size);
}
```

If you want to terminate iteration early, use `fs_free_iterator()` to free the iterator object.
`fs_next()` will free the iterator for you when it reaches the end.

Like when opening a file, you can specify `FS_OPAQUE`, `FS_VERBOSE` or `FS_TRANSPARENT` (default)
in `fs_first()` to control which files are enumerated. Enumerated files will be consistent with
what would be opened when using the same option with `fs_file_open()`.

Internally, `fs_first()` will gather all of the enumerated files. This means you should expect
`fs_first()` to be slow compared to `fs_next()`.

Enumerated entries will be sorted by name in terms of `strcmp()`.

Enumeration is not recursive. If you want to enumerate recursively you can inspect the `directory`
member of the `info` member in `fs_iterator`.



2. Thread Safety
================
The following points apply regarding thread safety.

  - Opening files across multiple threads is safe. Backends are responsible for ensuring thread
    safety when opening files.

  - An individual `fs_file` object is not thread safe. If you want to use a specific `fs_file`
    object across multiple threads, you will need to synchronize access to it yourself. Using
    different `fs_file` objects across multiple threads is safe.

  - Mounting and unmounting is not thread safe. You must use your own synchronization if you
    want to do this across multiple threads.

  - Opening a file on one thread while simultaneously mounting or unmounting on another thread is
    not safe. Again, you must use your own synchronization if you need to do this. The recommended
    usage is to set up your mount points once during initialization before opening any files.



3. Backends
===========
You can implement custom backends to support different file systems and archive formats. A stdio
backend is the default backend and is built into the library. A backend implements the functions
in the `fs_backend` structure.

A ZIP backend is included in the "extras" folder of this library's repository. Refer to this for
a complete example for how to implement a backend (not including write support, but I'm sure
you'll figure it out!).

The backend abstraction is designed to relieve backends from having to worry about the
implementation details of the main library. Backends should only concern themselves with their
own local content and not worry about things like mount points, archives, etc. Those details will
be handled at a higher level in the library.

Instances of a `fs` object can be configured with backend-specific configuration data. This is
passed to the backend as a void pointer to the necessary functions. This data will point to a 
backend-defined structure that the backend will know how to use.

In order for the library to know how much memory to allocate for the `fs` object, the backend
needs to implement the `alloc_size` function. This function should return the total size of the
backend-specific data to associate with the `fs` object. Internally, this memory will be stored
at the end of the `fs` object. The backend can access this data via `fs_get_backend_data()`:

```c
typedef struct my_fs_data
{
    int someData;
} my_fs_data;

...

my_fs_data* pBackendData = (my_fs_data*)fs_get_backend_data(pFS);
assert(pBackendData != NULL);

do_something(pBackendData->someData);
```

This pattern will be a central part of how backends are implemented. If you don't have any
backend-specific data, you can just return 0 from `alloc_size()` and simply not reference the
backend data pointer.

The main library will allocate the `fs` object, including any additional space specified by the
`alloc_size` function. Once this is done, it'll call the `init` function to initialize the backend.
This function will take a pointer to the `fs` object, the backend-specific configuration data, and
a stream object. The stream is used to provide the backend with the raw data of an archive, which
will be required for archive backends like ZIP. If your backend requires this, you should check
for if the stream is null, and if so, return an error. See section "4. Streams" for more details
on how to use streams. You need not take a copy of the stream pointer for use outside of `init()`.
Instead you can just use `fs_get_stream()` to get the stream object when you need it. You should
not ever close or otherwise take ownership of the stream - that will be handled at a higher level.

The `uninit` function is where you should do any cleanup. Do not close the stream here.

The `remove` function is used to remove a file. This is not recursive. If the path is a directory,
the backend should return an error if it is not empty. Backends do not need to implement this
function in which case they can leave the callback pointer as `NULL`, or have it return
`FS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

The `rename` function is used to rename a file. This will act as a move if the source and
destination are in different directories. If the destination already exists, it should be
overwritten. This function is optional and can be left as `NULL` or return `FS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

The `mkdir` function is used to create a directory. This is not recursive. If the directory already
exists, the backend should return `FS_SUCCESS`. This function is optional and can be left as `NULL`
or return `FS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

The `info` function is used to get information about a file. If the backend does not have the
notion of the last modified or access time, it can set those values to 0. Set `directory` to 1 (or
FS_TRUE) if it's a directory. Likewise, set `symlink` to 1 if it's a symbolic link. It is important
that this function return the info of the exact file that would be opened with `file_open()`.

Like when initializing a `fs` object, the library needs to know how much backend-specific data to
allocate for the `fs_file` object. This is done with the `file_alloc_size` function. This function
is basically the same as `alloc_size` for the `fs` object, but for `fs_file`. If the backend does
not need any additional data, it can return 0. The backend can access this data via
`fs_file_get_backend_data()`.

The `file_open` function is where the backend should open the file. If the `fs` object that owns
the file was initialized with a stream, i.e. it's an archive, the stream will be non-null. You
should store this pointer for later use in `file_read`, etc. The `openMode` parameter will be a
combination of `FS_READ`, `FS_WRITE`, `FS_TRUNCATE`, `FS_APPEND` and `FS_OVERWRITE`. When opening
in write mode (`FS_WRITE`), it will default to truncate mode. You should ignore the `FS_OPAQUE`,
`FS_VERBOSE` and `FS_TRANSPARENT` flags. If the file does not exist, the backend should return
`FS_DOES_NOT_EXIST`. If the file is a directory, it should return `FS_IS_DIRECTORY`.

The file should be closed with `file_close`. This is where the backend should release any resources
associated with the file. The stream should not be closed here - it'll be cleaned up at a higher
level.

The `file_read` function is used to read data from the file. The backend should return `FS_AT_END`
when the end of the file is reached, but only if the number of bytes read is 0.

The `file_write` function is used to write data to the file. If the file is opened in append mode,
the backend should seek to the end of the file before writing. This is optional and need only be
specified if the backend supports writing.

The `file_seek` function is used to seek the cursor. The backend should return `FS_BAD_SEEK` if the
seek is out of bounds.

The `file_tell` function is used to get the cursor position.

The `file_flush` function is used to flush any buffered data to the file. This is optional and can
be left as `NULL` or return `FS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

The `file_info` function is used to get information about an opened file. It returns the same
information as `info` but for an opened file.

The `file_duplicate` function is used to duplicate a file. The destination file will be a new file
and already allocated. The backend need only copy the necessary backend-specific data to the new
file.

The `first`, `next` and `free_iterator` functions are used to enumerate the contents of a directory.
If the directory is empty, or an error occurs, `fs_first` should return `NULL`. The `next` function
should return `NULL` when there are no more entries. When `next` returns `NULL`, the backend needs
to free the iterator object. The `free_iterator` function is used to free the iterator object
explicitly. The backend is responsible for any memory management of the name string. A typical way
to deal with this is to allocate the allocate additional space for the name immediately after the
`fs_iterator` allocation.

Backends are responsible for guaranteeing thread-safety of different files across different
threads. This should typically be quite easy since most system backends, such as stdio, are already
thread-safe, and archive backends are typically read-only which should make thread-safety trivial
on that front as well.


4. Streams
==========
Streams are the data delivery mechanism for archive backends. You can implement custom streams, but
this should be uncommon because `fs_file` itself is a stream, and a memory stream is included in
the library called `fs_memory_stream`. Between these two the majority of use cases should be
covered.

A stream is initialized using a specialized initialization function depending on the stream type.
For `fs_file`, simply opening the file is enough. For `fs_memory_stream`, you need to call
`fs_memory_stream_init_readonly()` for a standard read-only stream, or
`fs_memory_stream_init_write()` for a stream with write (and read) support. If you want to
implement your own stream type you would need to implement a similar initialization function.

Use `fs_stream_read()` and `fs_stream_write()` to read and write data from a stream. If the stream
does not support reading or writing, the respective function should return `FS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

The cursor can be set and retrieved with `fs_stream_seek()` and `fs_stream_tell()`. There is only
a single cursor which is shared between reading and writing.

Streams can be duplicated. A duplicated stream is a fully independent stream. This functionality
is used heavily internally by the library so if you build a custom stream you should support it
if you can. Without duplication support, you will not be able to open files within archives. To
duplicate a stream, use `fs_stream_duplicate()`. To delete a duplicated stream, use
`fs_stream_delete_duplicate()`. Do not use implementation-specific uninitialization routines to
uninitialize a duplicated stream - `fs_stream_delete_duplicate()` will deal with that for you.

Streams are not thread safe. If you want to use a stream across multiple threads, you will need to
synchronize access to it yourself. Using different stream objects across multiple threads is safe.
A duplicated stream is entirely independent of the original stream and can be used across on a
different thread to the original stream.

The `fs_stream` object is a base class. If you want to implement your own stream, you should make
the first member of your stream object a `fs_stream` object. This will allow you to cast between
`fs_stream*` and your custom stream type.

See `fs_stream_vtable` for a list of functions that need to be implemented for a custom stream. If
the stream does not support writing, the `write` callback can be left as `NULL` or return
`FS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

See `fs_memory_stream` for an example of how to implement a custom stream.

Streams.

The feeding of input and output data is done via a stream.

To implement a custom stream, such as a memory stream, or a file stream, you need to extend from
`fs_stream` and implement `fs_stream_vtable`. You can access your custom data by casting the
`fs_stream` to your custom type.

The stream vtable can support both reading and writing, but it doesn't need to support both at
the same time. If one is not supported, simply leave the relevant `read` or `write` callback as
`NULL`, or have them return FS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.

These functions are low-level functions for working with paths. The most important part of this API
is probably the iteration functions. These functions are used for iterating over each of the
segments of a path. This library will recognize both '\' and '/'. If you want to use just one or
the other, or a different separator, you'll need to use a different library. Likewise, this library
will treat paths as case sensitive. Again, you'll need to use a different library if this is not
suitable for you.

Iteration will always return both sides of a separator. For example, if you iterate "abc/def",
you will get two items: "abc" and "def". Where this is of particular importance and where you must
be careful, is the handling of the root directory. If you iterate "/", it will also return two
items. The first will be length 0 with an offset of zero which represents the left side of the "/"
and the second will be length 0 with an offset of 1 which represents the right side. The reason for
this design is that it makes iteration unambiguous and makes it easier to reconstruct a path.

The path API does not do any kind of validation to check if it represents an actual path on the
file system. Likewise, it does not do any validation to check if the path contains invalid
characters. All it cares about is "/" and "\".

Memory streams support both reading and writing within the same stream. To only support read-only
mode, use fs_memory_stream_init_readonly(). With this you can pass in a standard data/size pair.

If you need writing support, use fs_memory_stream_init_write(). When writing data, the stream will
output to a buffer that is owned by the stream. When you need to access the data, do so by
inspecting the pointer directly with `stream.write.pData` and `stream.write.dataSize`. This mode
also supports reading.

You can overwrite data by seeking to the required location and then just writing like normal. To
append data, just seek to the end:

    fs_memory_stream_seek(pStream, 0, fs_SEEK_ORIGIN_END);

The memory stream need not be uninitialized in read-only mode. In write mode you can use
`fs_memory_stream_uninit()` to free the data. Alternatively you can just take ownership of the
buffer and free it yourself with `fs_free()`.

Below is an example for write mode.

    ```c
    fs_memory_stream stream;
    fs_memory_stream_init_write(NULL, &stream);
    
    // Write some data to the stream...
    fs_memory_stream_write(&stream, pSomeData, someDataSize, NULL);
    
    // Do something with the data.
    do_something_with_my_data(stream.write.pData, stream.write.dataSize);
    ```

To free the data, you can use `fs_memory_stream_uninit()`, or you can take ownership of the data
and free it yourself with `fs_free()`:

    ```c
    fs_memory_stream_uninit(&stream);
    ```

Or to take ownership:

    ```c
    size_t dataSize;
    void* pData = fs_memory_stream_take_ownership(&stream, &dataSize);
    ```

With the above, `pData` will be the pointer to the data and `dataSize` will be the size of the data
and you will be responsible for deleting the buffer with `fs_free()`.


Read mode is simpler:

    ```c
    fs_memory_stream stream;
    fs_memory_stream_init_readonly(pData, dataSize, &stream);

    // Read some data.
    fs_memory_stream_read(&stream, &myBuffer, bytesToRead, NULL);
    ```

There is only one cursor. As you read and write the cursor will move forward. If you need to
read and write from different locations from the same fs_memory_stream object, you need to
seek before doing your read or write. You cannot read and write at the same time across
multiple threads for the same fs_memory_stream object.
